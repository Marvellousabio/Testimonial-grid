                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly
                  feel I got every penny’s worth.

                  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                  the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
              </h2>
              <p class="testimonial__statement text-dark-grey">
                  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                  100% recommend! ”
